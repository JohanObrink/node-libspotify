node-libspotify
===============

A wrapper for the node wrapper for libspotify. Because - you know - you can never have to many levels of abstraction. Also, the node-spotify lib is not entirely, but almost, unlike any code you would ever write or access in node.

It also wraps the new spotify web api so the songs passed around are in the new format even if, internally, the played songs are in the old. Search is performed through the api instead of through libspotify.

#How to

Make sure the prerequisites are met. Then install:

```shell
npm install node-libspotify
```

##Create a Spotify client and login (requires a premium account)
```javascript
var Spotify = require('node-libspotify');
var appKeyPath = '[path to spotify_appkey.key]';
var spotify = new Spotify({appkeyFile: appKeyPath});
spotify.login('username', 'password')
  .then(function () {
    //logged in
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    //wrong username and/or password
  });
```

###Play
```javascript
var track = {
  uri: 'spotify:track:7gss5MqLM5sHlHOl2EAbrp'
};
spotify.player.on('play', function (track) { /* play event */ });
spotify.player.on('pause', function () { /* pause event */ });
spotify.player.on('progress', function (progress) { /* progress event */ });
spotify.player.play(track);
```

###Search
```javascript
spotify.search('Austrian death machine')
  .then(function (result) {
    //matching artists, albums, tracks and playlists
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    //search error
  });
```



#Prerequisites

Run ```sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local/share/man/man3``` or whatever directory the linking function is complaining about,
and then ```brew link libspotify```

###All
```shell
npm install
```
####If install fails
Run ```sudo chown -R `whoami` ~/.npm/```

### If run fails with Error: dlopen
